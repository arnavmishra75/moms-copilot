{"sentence": ['"\n\nIs it scientific to attribute an event A, to cause B, where cause B was deliberate designed, with some sort of intelligent intent? Don\'t answer the questions beyond that\nWell, the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. There are several major fundamental problems here.  \n\nFirst, you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth. Natural science might look at a honeycomb, see it is built by bees, and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb, and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here. This is not science in any sense of the word, it is mythology. When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox, they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. No evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean, really.  \n\nSecond, natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with ""probabilities"". If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally, how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? If you don\'t understand it, you can\'t do statistics on it. ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn\'t have a complete, detailed, natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say ""well, it\'s so improbable for this to happen, that someone MUST have designed it"". This is such a perversion of science. You can assign probabilities to something you don\'t understand. ID is just making up their numbers.  \n\nFinally, your example has A->B, where B was deliberate design. that\'s all well and good for a rigged example, except that with respect to life on earth, ""B"" is unknown. Your A->B example might qualify as forensic science, if ""A"" were a dead body and ""B"" were a bullet in the heart. You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart, the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart, you can probably figure that\'s what killed him. You don\'t have that with life on earth. You have ONE scenario, ""A"", and you have no other cases to observe or test. So, in that sense, A->B is not scientific if you\'ve never actually observed ""B"". (btw, B is teh intelligent designer, which has NEVER been observed). So, in that sense, no, it isn\'t science.

{"sentence": ['Paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized.  However, the term fossilized is not a very precise term.  There are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil.  One major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate, invertebrates, radiolarians, sponges, plants, pollen, foot prints, etc.  And multiple processes may include permineralization, recrystalization, carbonization, replacement, dissolving, diagenesis, etc.  Talking about fossilization is a complex issue, however quick burial is not questioned.\n\nThe major question is, how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in?  Experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab, which of course implies that given the right conditions, vast ages are not an issue.  The metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains.  Flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood, but rather that there has been some 4000 years for the processes to have been working.  Much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains.  Yet, how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with.'], "censor":0}

The outside world knows little about these elusive characters, and the honour of the Witzeman. For those who have ever been a Witzeman, it has been said to have been a great honour, although the qualities needed for the job have never been disclosed. A person may not now they were a Witzeman for many years, until they are called by former Witzemans via dreams. Associates of the Witzeman are known to be a certain Babe Cool or the much lesser known Witzewoman.\n\nThe Present Witzeman is an 11-year-old boy namely Benjamin Woods, who is said to have become a Witzeman after he felt this 'awesome radiance in his top-right bumcheek'. He has not told a great number of people his testimony, but has promised to do so in years to come.\n\n                           History\nThe present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the Witzeman in present years, because former Witzemen have not been so public about the honour, to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time. The term 'Witzeman' is a compound word of the adjective Witze and 'man', witze being an 11th century term for 'a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence'. Unfortuneatly, Witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind, for unspeakable reasons.\n\n                       Proper History\nAs early as the 14th century, Witzemen were considered outcasts, and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks. This led to the 1st Witzeman Rebellion of 1555 when the current Witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local Council chess team. This rebellion further disgraced the Witzeman, as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced 'gaga' at a Government meeting that year. The period from here to the early 1900s was a dark time in the Witzemans history. However good times were to come for the Witzeman. Many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the Witzeman in the 1980s, building up to a great moment in the history...the Great Rebellion of 1988. This was when several Witzeman sprinted round the Visitors Gallery of the House of Commons, wearing clown masks, but otherwise completely naked. This was thought to be an act of circambulation. However many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour, were 'mentally, spiritually, and emotionallly scarred for life'. This group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability, suffering from trauma. It was at this time that the Government finally took positive action for the Witzeman. In 1990, a bill of rights for the Witzeman was signed, stating all Witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased. Although this was a formal agreement, many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the Government to the Witzeman, as the behaviour of the Witzeman and his followers became more and more twisted."], "censor":0}

The 1990 Constitution barred that as a possibility, and after the Kumanovo Military-Technical Agreement was signed between NATO and FRY the SRS broke its coalition with SPS and the government collapsed, causing new elections - because that was unconstitutional, as an act of highest treason, enough to be tried from maximum sentence (which the Radicals demanded from then to his death, to have a trial in Serbia, and to be tried for treason among other reasons).

Your input to Culture of Lithuania is welcomed. \nSome problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well-known ideological systems may raise here. I propose a quite liberal variant of it, where definition may not be connected with one certain word. Necessity however to follow certain classifying remains. \n\nMy initial ideas on this branch, the ones, concerning period of Lithuanian national Renaissance period: Some artists, writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as  modernists. This definition is not false, but some more concrete things should be added, some specifics of Lithuania. \nWe should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat. Renaissance from later modernism, which is more known for us. Cultural aspirations of the later Nat. Ren. may be defined as  modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania. But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage, and their expression may be seen as something simply typically  Lithuanian. I mean, that such authors in as  Čiurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context, but it also (and even more) is a representative of Lithuanian culture, when in European or World-wide context. A parallel  example may be taken from literature of India. Poet  Tagore, well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India. Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture. But in his own country, he was seen as a modernist too, who was changing traditional cultural forms, especially stagnated ones. This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N. Ren. could be seen as modernists, which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones, in Lithuanian context. They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context, but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture. Čiurlionis is the best example here. \nIn other way, the later Lithuanian modernists (they depended mostly to later  generation, approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century) concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose (looking generally) was  to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life (see the table below). \nWe see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. The problem is, that both movements collaborated, especially their political wings did, and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. So, many researchers don\'t pay attention to this difference. Especially in the Soviet period, when national ideas were officially forbidden, mixture in description of these movements was allowed. E. g. philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas, who clearly depends to the first generation, is often described as liberal. And it may be understood in a sense of the second generation (as idea of liberalism).\n \n\n period and generation  artists, writers, philosophers etc in a context of Lithuania in an European context The National Renaissance period, the younger generation, approx 1905 – 1930  painter and composer  Čiurlionis, painter Kazys Šimonis, poet and philosopher Vilius Storastas - Vydūnas, dramatist Sofija Kymantaitė - Čiurlionienė, poets Adomas Jakštas, Motiejus Gustaitis, Liudas Gira, composer Stasys Šimkus, philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas.  reformers and innovators of Lithuanian culture Representatives of Lithuanian culture, almost unknown before them.

I do not want that happenning.\n\nCould you please follow the instructions in the link I provided?. Thank you. \n\n Randroide answers to New reference by Burgas00 \n\n  At last we agree on something!...of course that the new section is a good idea: The false ""suicidal"" terrorists from PRISA will also be included there. \n\nCome oooooon, boys, start writing that section. I do not want all the kudos for myself: The new proposed article is, by now, an effort made only by me. \n\nBut remember: NPOV and sources, all the sources. Just like me citing ""El País"" in the section about the doubts about the genuineness of the 13th bomb. Cheers  \n\n \n\nIndeed, a good point. And all the remarks in COPE too. And the ""moral certitudes"" of Mariano Rajoy published in El Mundo.\n\n  I agree with you 100%, Larean.\n\n  What Randroide omits to mention on the section about the 13th bomb is that he only added balancing references when I insisted that he do so, the original version he created was entirely POV, as is much of the rest of the proposed article. Also, all the sources that he added from El Pais are only available to subscribers - NPOV it is not. \n\n  You are right, Southofwatford, in your ""Randroide omits..."" section.\n\nIf you have not subscription to ""El País"", I am sorry but that´s your problem. My ""institutional"" access also has some advantages, like paid access to ""El País"" (and many, many other publications and books). That´s one of the reasons for my exclusive use of ""filtered"" Internet accesss: It´s much easier for me to work here due to the easy availability of sources.\n\nDo you see?. The truncation of words is offsett (I think) by better sources.\n\nBTW, if you write under a ""Randroide answers"" section you are:\nInvading ""my"" space. I do not mind, really. But you are doing it.\nRisking new truncations on your messages. To avoid this, please write OUTSIDE ""Randroide answers"" sections.\n\nIf you think that the proposed article is POV, work in it to make it NPOV. The article is not ""mine"".\n\n  I\'ll take the risk of you truncating the reply and put it here, it\'s very short. The issue is not whether I subscribe to El País, its whether the people who read an article in the English Wikipedia subscribe to it. All sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article, putting in a source that readers will not be able to see just so you can claim the article is NPOV is, to my mind, completely unreasonable.\n\n  \n\nAll sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article\n\nVery funny, Southofwatford. \n\nI am going to follow this joke of yours.\n\nPlease propose also the deletion of all books as sources, because, did you know?, there is always someone without this or that book.\nDelete all references to TV or radio stations, because that user in Brazil has no TV and no radio at home.\nDelete all the references in spanish, because, did you know?, there are users who know no spanish.\n\nIt´s a pleasure to read this kind of funny jokes, really. I had a good laugh.\n\nUser:Southofwatford  How strange that you should find it so funny, after all most of the sources we are providing should enable users to find out more information about what is being sourced, so to deliberately choose sources that require those users to pay to see the information is not funny, it\'s simply bizarre. Equally, in the English Wikipedia I would argue that choosing a Spanish or other foreign language source when an equally valid source exists in English does not make sense, except perhaps to those who are too busy laughing - your cynicism is evident in your response.\n\n 08:3'], "censor":0}

{"sentence": ['"\n\n66.185.85.80\'s rant\n\nPresently, we are witnessing  an open war against Croatian Dinaric culture.  Croatian Left often portrays this culture as ""primitive"" and ""rural"" (even ""fashist"") being  in  service of Conservative HDZ party. Croatian writer Predrag Raos, for instance, ""performed"" on gusle instrument in Zagreb on several occasions this year (2004) with only one intention - to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition.\n \nAnother ""apostle"" of Croatian Left - Miljenko Jergović - refers to his political opponents on the Right as ""gusle players"". \n\nSome even claim the Serbian origin of Croatian Dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater Serbian propagabda (all štokavian people and their culture are Serbian). However, Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian. Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture. For example, the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music, Marko Kraljević, is associated with Dalmatian island Hvar through Petar Hektorović\'s book ""Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje"", 1568). Also, the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  Dubrovnik (1547). Even now, a contemporary Croatian writer (born in Dubrovnik) Stijepo Mijović Kočan tells us a story about his uncle (also from Dubrovnik area) who could memorize numerous gusle songs (Stijepo Mijović Kočan: Gusle, Glasnik, May 25, 1992, p. 42). Dubrovnik is also a home of Anica Begin (born Kalafatović, 1816), a daughter of famous gusle player Ante. Although illiterate, she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs, some of which were recorded in antology of Croatian folk poetry. \n \nNot far from Dubrovnik, another coastal city - Makarska – was  also a bastion of Croatian gusle music. Actually, this region could be considered the Capital of all Croatian gusle players. This Mediterranean area  also gave birth to  Andrija Kačić Miošić (18th century Catholic priest), who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of Croatia and beyond. To honour Kačić\'s work, Ivan Meštrović, the most famous Croatian sculptor, built a sculpture in America showing Kačić in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument.  \n\nIn addition to Kačić, Makarska Littoral produced a great many other followers of Croatian gusle music. According to dr. fra Karlo Jurišić (who quotes the work of Croatian folklorist Stipan Banović), Zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with Stipan Kosović-Kudrić (1771-1818) and culminating with the most known Mate Banović – Trliš (1844-1915).  As for Dalmatian women, they didn\'t play gusle (it\'s    considered   a male activity only), yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound. \n\nOlinko Delorko, the researcher of  Dalmatian  folk poetry in the 1960s, states in his book Ljuba Ivanova (1969) that most of his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women, especially the ones from the island of Hvar. \n\nThe Zadar Littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. English writer Maude M. Holbach, travelling through Zadar region in the first decade of 20th century  states in her book  ""Dalmatia: The Land Where East Meets West"" that the gusle was the national instrument of the region. As for Dinaric dances, which took place at markets and certain festivals, they  are very picturesque and interesting, and worth going a long way to see, being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in Europe (p.54)\n\nThis admiration for Dinaric folk music, particularly gusle, was seen in both Dalmatian Litteral and  Hinterland.  Matija Murko, the researcher of this literary/music forms,  had reported   that during his trips  through Dalmatia in the 1930s, he saw a child, barely three years old playing gusle (Eduard Osredečki: “Hrvatske narodne junačke pjesme”, Željezno-Beč, p. 9)\n\nNow, lets  take a look at  the names of some Dalmatian sports clubs and organizations: Hajduk, Junak, Gusar, Alkar, Uskok, sinjska alka, etc. What do they have in common? Of course, their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region. \n\nHaving this in mind, one wonders why this proud Croatian heritage has become almost  extinct.  Why do we have so few gusle players today ? Is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern Croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock \'n\' roll  culture ? If so, why has tamburitza music of Northern Croatia  gained wide acceptance from the Croatian establishment while its  Dinaric counterpart (gusle music) is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre'], "censor":0}

But the final debate on 8 October was a mean Parliamentary occasion. Two days before, in a meeting which was something of a suave qui puet, the Cabinet decided to take it as a vote of confidence, preferring to go out on the Campbell case to a defeat on the Russian Treaties which might give the left wing too much prominence.—Middlemas and Barnes, p. 273.

The sources used to build Wikipedia are academic sources, therefore JEDP and its 20-21st century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia, while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to WP:UNDUE. This does not mean that Wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong (Wikipedia has no theology of its own), but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view. Of course, this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties, since as Ehrman said in one of his bestsellers, US mainline Protestant and Catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes. So, in a sense, scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions. Only fundamentalist seminaries and divinity schools choose to default against historical criticism.

{"sentence": ['":::::::::: Tim, firstly I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline, and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favour. Yes I certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in, there is clearly a massive diffence between, say having offices in the French or Japanese jurisdictions, or between the Chinese and U.S. jurisdictions, since the legal and regulatory systems are very different, as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets.\n\n Beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in, say, Paris or Toulouse, even though they are both in the same jurisdiction. I appreciate that the situation in the U.S. is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions. Even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though. To give an example, the San Jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the Los Angeles market, but it will also have a quite different profile - on the whole a lot more specialist, niche and focused on high tech. \n\n To give another example, in the UK a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didn\'t have an office in London, even if it had offices in every other big city. In fact all of the very top tier UK firms (DLA Piper is not yet regarded as one of them, despite its size) have just one UK office, in London, although they have other offices overseas. \n\n Saying that DLA has "" has 69 offices across the United States, Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, Thailand, China, ..."" would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader. We could fall back on using descriptions like ""in major financial centres"" or ""in major commercial centres"" or ""in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres"" but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecesssary element of vagueness, imprecision and even original research.\n\n I do accept that DLA, with 69 offices, is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article. However I do also feel that there is an important general point of principal that information about the office locations of a law firm is very valuable information to aid the reader of an article in understanding the subject of it, and should be included as much as possible.  \n\n"'], "censor":0}

Does OR add clutter? Sure it can, but if the user in question was REALLY concerned about that, about the quality of the article and about extraneous details, WHY DIDN\'T HE/SHE EVEN NOTICE two paragraphs already there, comprising about 1/3 of the entire article, dealt with Norman Schwarzkopf, an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name? I\'ll tell you why: the user wasn\'t engaged in good-faith/goodwill editing and the normal back-and-forth that leads to better articles. He/she was involved in blocking input to the article. Why? Was it personal against me, or was it to preserve the existing content of the article, including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand? I can only speculate, but I\'d guess it\'s some sort of power trip and wiki-bullying. I don\'t really have time for this. I have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isn\'t directly related to content and improving articles. I could pretend this user didn\'t do what he/she did, but I\'m wasting my own time here and I don\'t really have a stake in any such pretense. I don\'t have any stake in improving this article either, no dog in the race, I just see how it can be improved and made more informative. As a long-term wikipedia user and editor, I don\'t see any problem in jumping in and fixing something. I almost expect some sort of pushback now, but not over completely minor edits which are very good and on-target in very minor stub-like articles. The problem isn\'t me here, it\'s that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior, and they are getting away with it, wikipedia becomes a much poorer place, a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share. Also, I don\'t recal ever having called him/her a bot, I think you put those words in my mouth, perhaps inadvertently. His/her behavior is malicious, but probably not malware, just the normal human collection of problems. I think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper, he/she isn\'t quite qualified for that at this point anyway, and it\'s having a very chilling effect across wikipedia. I won\'t egnage in a battle of the wikipedia rule acronyms, I will continue to write in English, and to read articles on wikipedia in English, and to think of ways to improve them in English. I am fully aware of how the terms ""vandlism"" are used and misused here, and most of the rest of the wikijargon. Nothing new under the sun here. If you read the edits I made carefully, and note the times of the reverts and the history of actions by that other user, you will see I\'m not off the mark here at all. I know what\'s going on.

{"sentence": ['"\n\n Question on Possible Citation \n\nI\'m sorry if I missed your question - I don\'t pay much attention to that page. In response to your question, let me start by repeating my boilerplate formulation: The job of Wikipedia editors is to verifiably summarize reliable sources using the neutral point of view. (I haven\'t yet worked in ""no original research"".) WP:NOR says that we mustn\'t integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions. Comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research. We can integrate information, so long as we don\'t arrive at new theories. Another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy. The more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate. \n\nGetting down to details, the Predators and Editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source. The Bauer site, even if somewhat unreliable, may be used in a limited fashion as a primary source about Bauer. I\'m not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct. However I would say that your proposed text appears reasonable. The sources are sufficient, and no original conclusions are made. The website takedown issue is confusing to me, but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources. \n\nOverall, my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better. Attack articles are not encouraged. While we must show our subjects ""warts and all"" we shouldn\'t enlarge the warts, nor ignore their better features. Balance is a part of NPOV. - \n\n""but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources."" There no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war. It is alleged the website takdown was instigated by Bauer. It isn\'t clear if she did, and other factors between the forum and the IP are not known. It was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs. I don\'t see how that can be objective. \n\n Bauer \nI\'m sorry I did not get back to you about the Usenet stuff et al., but I\'ve been somewhat overloaded at work. Personally, I think the article is better now than when I first saw it, thanks to a lot of effort on the part of the primary editors of the article to bring the best sources and present them in a way that doesn\'t seem like a lynch mob. Y\'all are doing a good job, and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted . I\'m glad to help and try and make the article neater, and I don\'t mean to sound brusque in the summary field, but there was a lot to cram in there. Thanks for the note, I appreciate it!   \n I would say Karen saying I\'ve called her names is an out and out fabrication. I\'ve never done any such thing. \n\n""or whether it\'s because he\'s been able to insult me and call me names on Wikipedia, repeatedly and without consequences""\n\nI\'ve accused her and Jule of carrying the water for TNH and Absolutewrite and they have. That isn\'t namecalling by a long stretch. I\'m really weary of these attacks over this. This is mob rule. While avi seems genuine, she\'s hanging with a tough insulting tribe. The threats against me are real and escalating by the hour. Blaming me won\'t make my points any less valid. Nobody likes to be piled on by a crowd. It\'s the Internet equivalent of stoning. \n\nThis is not a fabrication. I get awfully tired of being called a troll, or part of a mob or cult or ""group troll,"" or a ""self-interested partisan,"" or a ""blog comment commando,"" or other things I could point at if I wanted to depress myself. You also made a ""theoretical"" comment about me being ""nosy, fat and ugly."" Putting the word ""if"" in front of it doesn\'t make it any less of an insult.

I was under the obviously mistaken impression that Wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts, knowledge and information. The notion that the Stradbroke Galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about, discussed and investigated for more than 100 years by historians and historical groups such as the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, the Maritime Archaeology Association of Queensland and many more too numerous to include here. There exists, in various libraries, books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which I have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the WP domain. The fact that a story is not accepted by ""mainstream"" academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions. What has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group (i.e. Hesperian and his friends) who are representatives of the ""mainstream"" view. Hesperian complain about the media coverage I have recieved but this never appeared in any of the WP contributions I made and Hesperian\'s mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for Hesperian\'s antagonistic attitude, simple, old fashioned professional jealousy. Thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by Hesperian for personal reasons. For example the Portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an Aboriginal midden, identified by a Spanish Musuem offical and story told to me by a UQ Archaeology PhD student is very relevant to the theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia. This kind of knowledge suppression is not what Wiki is about but I guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by Hesperian and his little band of mates, which is a pity, but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should I expect Wiki be any different.

Wikipedia\'s job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is.  Any attempt to do that is original research.\n\nInstead of ""truth"", Wikipedia aims for ""verifiability"".  Put a different way, Wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion (not our opinions but those of reliable sources).  If the truth is clear and uncontroversial, it is easy for us to report that.  If the truth is murky and controversial, it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic EVEN if these reliable sources conflict.  Where Wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents ""THE TRUTH"" and not just one perspective (or POV) on the topic at hand.\n\nI have been trying to hit this NPOV ""sweet spot"" but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides.\n\n \nObviously is, because some users (Jadger and Wikiferdi) don\'t want to discuss in fact, they want us to agree with their POV, that\'s not discussion about the NPOV edits.

Czechoslovakia, being the only functioning democracy in the region by the 1930s, had closer ties with the West than Poland did, and was ""betrayed"" in a much more obvious and tangible way than Poland was: The West politically accepted the country\'s territorial mutilation, which was not the case with Poland. \n\nThat said, I am not sure if the inclusion of countries such as Finland, the Baltics, Yugoslavia, or even Ukraine (which had never been independent in the first place) is a good idea.

This is simply not reflected at all in the Ainsworth article. I tried reflecting it as follows: ""His appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the Prime Minister, who ""considered at least three other candidates before appointing Ainsworth"" but this was dismissed as ""speculative opinion"" by Off2riorob above, even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in Ainsworth’s biography. Perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found—which I suspect should not be difficult—that it can be re-included? I want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against Ainsworth, but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end (and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment).

That was like the 2nd day almost two months ago.\n\nAll of my references are verifiable.There\'s nothing in the article about my law suit or my being put in jail for engaging in pro se litigation.  I didn\'t put my experiences in the Judge Edward Nottingham article either although he was my judge.\n\nI went out of my way to search for references expressing all the various sides of the issue. For instance, I wrote to the ABA and asked for their input, and in fact, asked them to work on the article. I also posted about issues involved with mediation and settlement with pro ses, citing references from a lawyers point of view.  Those references were deleted by someone, I can\'t remember who and don\'t know why. At this point, the only reference that I posted that is soft at all is a blog quoting a transcript quoting a former federal judge and I know for sure that is a valid transcript.  The guy who runs the blog is a 3rd year law student and has a business selling data services exclusively to lawyers.   Even the stuff that was deleted about pro se frustration I had references for. I read in the Wikipedia discussion of sources that blogs can be used in some contexts.\n\nI don\'t believe that I did any original research. All I did is search the Internet for references for the article.  I really didn\'t know about unbundled attorney services or the amount of pro se litigation before I started working on this article. I had already been thinking about forms based filing but I started thinking about that anyway because of my experiences with ECF, which date back to 2004.  Also, when I was younger I worked as a systems analyst.\n\nI did get the info on the Laws and Liberties of MA years ago, but Wikipedia already had an article on that and it probably would have come up anyway.  Same as the U.N. covenantcan\'t really hide that.   I didn\'t add a and b together to prove a point, at least not consciously. Like today, I was reviewing appellate procedures and it seemed that the 5th Circuit had a more pro se friendly tone, which I think is because of Judge Learned Hand, who was in the fifth circuit. And the only reason I know about that is that one time I went in every federal circuit and searched on the words ""pro se"" in the 40s because I was trying to see if there was a history of putting pro ses in jail for being pro se (No, there was not).  What I found in the 40s was that some circuits denied all the pro se appeals without even saying why but Judge Learned Hand seemed pro se friendly.\n\nI believe that your posting things about pro se litigants getting an unfair advantage is ""soap boxing"". I do understand your wanting to win thru competition though and about law as a business. I\'ve been an entrepreneur. \n\nI didn\'t know about the Federal Judicial Center until I started working on this article. That book on appellate procedure I found looking for references for this article. The manual on complex litigation I found looking for references for this article.\n\nArguing with you helps me to clarify the issues for myself.  One thing I started thinking about a lot in the past few weeks is slavery and how that affected the history of pro se litigation. I ordered the book Slave Nation at the library but I haven\'t got it yet. But now when I look at pro se law in the different states I think free state, slave state, border state. Also, there were issues related to Indians in some of the western states. The labor union movement had a lot to do with it too, I think. So did the history of workmen\'s comp, which is of course related to unions.  "'], "censor":0}

You know, as opposed to being a piece of Zionist propaganda being passed off as fair and balanced.\n\nThis entire article is full of baseless jewish propaganda. It is well documented the Banu Qurayza were executed for treason. That is what merited them the death penalty, that they commited treason. The Quarash and other tribes the Muslims fought against were outright enemies who were persecuting them from the start. But the Qurayza signed a peace treaty, then broke it by aiding the enemy. This article contains soo much jewish propaganda that you\'d think they were executed for no reason (which no doubt is their aim). Here is a great example. Look at this citation\n\n""According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa\'d ibn Mua\'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself after the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir: ""Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery."" Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba\'s gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.""\n\nThis author is Norman A Stillman, a Zionist Jew who is very biased. Why is he being used as a quote in an Islamic article? And further more, why is his baseless conjecture allowed to be used, as if it\'s a fact?\n\nThere are articles for ""Criticisms of Islam"" where the Jews and others can write whatever they want. But they should have no hand in editing Islamic articles. Because I looked up the Jewish articles and I noticed they dont allow dissent there. You cant put a Muslim perspective on evil acts commited by Jews, without it disappearing instantly. So the same standard MUST be applied to Islamic articles. Islamic articles must be written from the Islamic point of view, and the jews can write their responses in appropriate ""criticisms of Islam"" articles. If not, I will personally edit the Jewish articles and fill them with my conjectures about their history. And I will find a non-Jewish admin to arbitrate over the Islamic articles.\n\nGood day.\n\n  \n\nPlease read this talk page, specifically all of the places where ""treason"" or ""traitor"" is mentioned, and if you still believe that we need to mention treason, provide some reliable sources and we can discuss it.

Bat Yeor is an academic scholar and though her books are controversial, she is not beyond the pale - currently she doesn\'t serve as a reference in the article but if she did, the controversy would be noted. As for Ramadan I have issues with him as well but if we remove him from the literature section, we would have to remove him from the article too, in which he serves as a reference. This is due to the insistence of User:Bless sins. He will certainly not like such a removal. We cannot remove him from the literature section while retaining him in the article.\nWhile your first version was needlessly verbose (""it is to be noted that""), the new one endorses that view by Paret/Watt. The article now says that the BQ were not killed for religious reasons - that is not a fact, since there is a good case that the whole conflict was caused by religious differences.\nAlso we do not want to repeat things that have already been said in the coverage of the ""siege and demise"", e.g. the claim about attacking M. in the rear.\nAlso, please abide by the one resolved conflict.

However, this problem disappears if we consider only the special case a=e. So let's do that.\n\nWe want a function f satisfying f(1)=e and f(n+1)=exp(f(n)), defined as widely as possible. We observe that n=0 and n=1 present no problems: f(0)=1 and f(-1)=0.\n\nTo extend f to all positive real numbers, it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length 1, such as [0,1).\n\nAnd we want f to be continuously differentiable. (The paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on (0,1), or equivalently on (-1,0). This is obviously whacky, but we needn't worry about this because a=e.)\n\nNext, for no obvious (or explained) reason we require that f ' is monotone on the interval [0,1]. From the functional equation f(x) = ln f(x+1) we get f '(x) = f '(x+1)/f(x+1). Hence f '(-1)=f '(0)/f(0)=f '(0), so f ' must be constant on [0,1]! \n\nNot too surprisingly, the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way: f(x) = exp[x](exp(x-[x])).\n\nThus what I learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between -1 and 0."], "censor":0}

Wade  there's no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved  there are other articles for that linked at the bottom  just state the facts about the case.

Usage of words like ""exhibit"" and ""attitude"", and refusing to follow the section title requirements on my page, show an obvious malfeasance intent by the above person, and therefore the block cannot be valid because within the first sentence he has already seriously demonstrated his lack of appropriate intent by specifically and purposefully being antagonizing.  \n\nThe second claim is physically possible, but is blatantly false.

Having OTHER USERS delete my comments, participate in blatant fradulent..ism, post the same thing on multiple talk pages at once for the purpose of harassing me, etc., is hardly ""myself making it difficult to communicate,"" when in fact as was just demonstrated I did the LITERAL EXACT OPPOSITE of this by LITERALLY ATTEMPTING TO PREVENT OTHER USERS FROM MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE.  ((In addition, if I wish for other users to NOT communicate with me, I also have THAT right, it is in fact specifically written into law in every state in the country and will get you arrested if you fail to do so.  Although I personally disagree with this law and it is an immoral law which deems to prevent for example ex-spouses from communicating with each other when necessary, the part of the law that refers to STRANGERS such as on Wikipedia or anywhere on the Internet, it is a PERSONAL CHOICE whether you wish other strangers on the site to communicate with you or not and/or post contact information etc.  That is why every message board in existence has an option to ""disable the private messaging system"".))\n\nThere were no personal attacks done by me anywhere, so this part is a baseless and fraudulent claim.\n\n""Refusal to abide by the site\'s guidelines"" is impossible since 1) ""guidelines"" and ""rules"" are two different thing 2) Wikipedia does not have any rules and 3) All policies of any kind are subject to debate and protest at any time according to the numerous Wikipedia articles which specifically say this.\n\nYou have also demonstrated more incorrect intent by saying that something was ""done in multiple venues,"" even though no venues of any kind exist because this is a website rather then a collection of several different building which show concerts or other entertainment events and/or conventions and/or etc.  So that is also impossible.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 "'], "censor":0}

{"sentence": ['And \n\nPaganism\n\nSouthgate, who has a degree in theology and religious studies from Canterbury University, rejected Catholicism and moved towards neo-pagan and heathen groups that are ‘very loyal to the Gods of the Northern Tradition’, including the Odinic Rite, the Tribe of the Wulfings and the A ´ satru´ Alliance, a pagan movement concerned with practising rituals and magic and led by Valguard (Mike) Murray, a former member of the American Nazi Party.91 Further evidence of this transition from Catholicism to paganism emerged in an interview with Wotan, the organ of the Charlemagne Hammer Skins.92 Southgate believed that Wotan’s celebration of the heroes of the Norse pantheon represented ‘the most genuine expression of European spirituality, culture and identity’.93 Another key expression of this ‘identity’ is exhibited by Southgate’s interest in the militaristic cult of Mithras and the ‘pagan spirituality’ of the apostate Roman emperor Julian II.94\n\nThis rejection of Christianity has an avowedly antisemitic dimension. Through the figure of Christ, Christianity has Judaic roots and is therefore irredeemably tainted; only the ‘weak’ continue to worship a ‘dead Jew’.95 The emphasis on the Judaic roots of Christianity, however, is regarded as of secondary importance to its usurpation of the rituals, sacraments and hierarchy of the ancient pagan solar religion Mithras, which was introduced into Iran and India by marauding Aryan tribes from the Russian steppes between BCE 2000 and 1500 before spreading to the Roman empire. Although it failed to defeat early Christianity in the battle for religious supremacy during the fourth century, Mithras continues to be viewed by esoteric thinkers (including Evola and Jung) as an alternative path the West could have followed. It retains its appeal as an initiatory cult or aristocratic order akin to the Knights Templar or, latterly, Himmler’s SS which, the NRF claims, had its origins in various ‘Anarchist droite ’ circles l e the Black Sun and the Thule Society. While Christianity tried to neuter this vital expression of the ‘Aryan psyche’, the awareness of Europe’s ‘Faustian’ destiny is currently enjoying a renaissance within the occult milieu. These ideas were also absorbed by thinkers like Evola and Rene´ Gue´non who discerned in them the fragments of a ‘hidden albeit distinct and fundamental truth’.96 For Southgate, as for Evola, Tradition is an ‘an underlying current which both permeates and transcends all’.97\n\nSouthgate’s discovery of Evolian ‘Primordial Tradition’ and his consequent rejection of Catholicism as ‘the sole cosmological truth’ ran in tandem with his immersion in the industrial music scene.98 This ‘cultural vanguard’ is spearheaded by a number of Gothic-Industrial, Dark Ambient, Black and ‘Viking’ Metal bands, including Allerseelen, Blood Axis, Burzum, Current 93, Dark Holler, Death in June, Endura, Mayhem, Ostara, Puissance and Sol Invictus, though it also encompasses more commercial bands like Cradle of Filth.99 Although it would be an exaggeration to say that these groups conform to a defined political agenda, their music serves to diffuse the ideals of Mithraic paganism and Nordic folk myths within this youthful underground subculture far more effectively than any number of meetings and marches could, thus providing the ‘perfect antidote’ to the spiritually enervating, multiracial values of a globalizing ‘system’. Southgate has also noted the potential of the Straight Edge punk movement and its hard core of puritanically intolerant followers, an interesting development given (exaggerated) reports of an emerging ‘anti-anti-establishment’ pro-Bush right-wing punk movement.100 Although Southgate realizes that the groupuscular right cannot control music-orientated youth cultures, he believes a minority can be induced ‘to take a direction basically conducive to our aims’.101 Southgate seeks to do this through his online magazine Synthesis, which features a music section replete with interviews and gig reviews.102\n\nThis is not simply cynical manipulation. Southgate appears genuinely interested in the counter culture he seeks to target. His fanzine, Tribal Resonance, ‘the voice of the racial avant-garde’, reveals Southgate’s strategy of linking his ideas to ‘the common language and the big ideas of our culture’.103 Through the medium of musical subcultures and the creation of alternatives ‘from without’, Southgate hopes to permeate existing political subcultures transversally, as the Nazis did, through a process of ‘cultural osmosis’ that aims to recode the ‘social symbology’ of the host culture so that its ideas can metastasize throughout the body politic, recalibrating its genetic inheritance. By creating ‘cultural hegemony’ the groupuscular right believes it can forge the ‘political space’ necessary for political and racial hegemony.104\n\nThe struggle for cultural heg'], "censor":0}

While he acknowledges that this is not the direct cause of anti-French sentiments, he argues that it explains why these sentiments can be expressed publicly, without being seen as a gross violation of political correctness. Vaïsse contends that by comparison, the public display of such sentiments towards other ethnic groups or nationalities would be met by strong disapproval. He proposes that as France has no powerful and organised lobby to defend it, it is socially and politically acceptable in the United States to express negative sentiments of the FrenchPierre Verdaguer, ""A Turn-of-the-Century Honeymoon?

The only possibility to join the Schengen zone would be to enter into a treaty with the EU, which includes a clause that Schengen-related EU law would be applicable in the associated non-EU state. The associated state would only have the right to be consulted. Thus, the U.S. would have to accept each and every majority (!) decision taken in Brussels whether citizens of this or that country would need a visa for entry into the area or not. And the U.S. would have to accept that every third-country national holding a residence title of a Schengen state could enter the U.S. without even being checked. To BIL: Guadeloupe and French Guiana are not inside the Schengen area because this would e.g. require France to equip the complete rain forest border between French Guiana and Suriname, Brasil etc. with high-tech infrared sensors which would detect every monkey which is crossing the border - just in order to avoid ID checks on flights between there and Europe.

I have been editing this article out of a desire to ensure it meets the standards and conventions of the English Wikipedia. I am sorry you had a negative experience with the German Wikipedia, but that is a separate project from this English project. Assuming good faith is a fundamental principle of the English Wikipedia; I advise you to give editors a chance instead of assuming the worst. I inquired about Silesian/Polish because Silesians are sometimes considered a separate ethnic group. I am not sure what you mean by ""reverting the article upside down""; my editing has been done to ensure that its formatting and style is consistent with other biographical articles. As I do not anticipate being able to copy-edit the article further, I am removing it from my watchlist. Good luck with the article. Olessi  \n\nThanks for you comments, and in fact fruitful discussion. You are right that the work of a person is most important.\nHowever, there are much present and past propaganda, which destroy the peace. If only some people would show objectivity and patience, as you did, it could be clear up. To mention nationality is however important, since exceptional individuals inspire new generation of a nation. (Unfortunately, nations or ethnic groups will still exist. I have to hope for peaceful coexistence of them, and fair competition. Seems to me that competition has to exit too – best if for fun only.)\nI am conscious that English and German Wikipedias are separate projects, but you see, when I approach German Wiki, Dzierzon article the Polish relevant article was attacked by some German/Silesian/Polish guy. It cost me more then here on En Wiki to settle the Pl article well. So sorry if you did feel bad about my attitude, possibly I explained more my excitement.\n\nWith Silesian is in short like this: Originally, they were Slavic tribe, spoke Polish, as I mentioned. For some 300 to 500 hundred years there were under German governments. They had bad time as you possibly can imagine. Many of them married with German and were/are of course confused who they are. You know, the pressure on east of resilient nation and of course Polish-German conflicts continued. Finally in 1945 Poland returned and become new problem for some of the natives. Even those who honestly considered himself Polish Silesians at the end of war could be persecuted. There in Poland was complete disorder. Soviets and Communists arrived, most of them real simpletons any way. “National” government - just pro-soviet mafia, was mostly occupied with fight against democratic opposition. Polish borders were shifted. We lost some 20% of our area and millions of people from east territories moved to present west Poland. You can imagine that most of them were not intellectuals at all, some of them completely simple people. They spoke different Polish dialect also. On top of this in the post war, pro-soviet atmosphere criminals found good playground. Well, I do not know if you are familiar with criminal minds – unfortunately I am. This is like gangrene on fresh wound, literally. Thus many of the native Silesian could be robber in Poland, which they wanted so much. I believe that in such conditions many simpletons could use the opportunity accusing natives to be Germans.\n\nNow, the present time, some of the falsely accused people remember the tragic experiences and want rehabilitation and apology – they could be absolutely right. However, there are many Germans who want their property back and some just using opportunity to stir in internal Polish affairs - despite the final border agreement between Poland and Germany signed on 14 November 1990 and governments effort to improve relations.\nFinaly I have to say, I beleave that Polish are hospitable and very often naïve. Not many realize that politic need caution. Those who realize that have a hard time to wake up the naïves. Some procentage remember lectures of history, and objectively, too many Germans are toublemakers. I am also convinced there exists something like national character. You can have obviously you own opinion, let me have my own.\nReturning to Silesians it is something close to squaring the circle . I wish the true Silesian all the best but I do not want Fith Column  on Polish terytory in addition.\n\nSorry if I used posibly ofencive ""reverting the article upside down"" that was in the heat of the battle, wich I still have with Ge Wiki. They just arogantly do not answer if they do not like and refuse mediatior at any imaginative pretext. That sucks.\n\nSorry and thanks again.

As such, the photo may not be used on Wikipedia, except perhaps under fair use policy (which probably doesn\'t apply), or under panorama freedom (depending on what the copyright law of India says on this topic).\n:Image:Bipasha.jpg - Image description page implies that it is licensed for non-commercial use only (contradicting your copyright tag); such a restriction is not acceptable on Wikipedia. In addition, the link to the original source (which could clarify which condition is correct) of the image is missing.\n:Image:Bom.jpg - The link to the original source at flickr is missing; author uploads images to flickr as ""all rights reserved"". \n:Image:Chowpatti.jpg - To verify that the image is indeed under the license you claim, the author should probably e-mail the Wikimedia Foundation and confirm that it is indeed under that license.\n:Image:Hydmall.jpg - The flickr page states that it is under a Creative Commons No-Derivative license; a license that prohibits the image to be modified/used in derivative works is not acceptable on Wikipedia, either.\n:Image:Infobangalore.jpg - No evidence of the image being under a free license.\n:Image:Brigaderoad.jpg - Flickr page states ""all rights reserved"".\n:Image:Hoogly.jpg - The link to the original source at flickr is missing; author uploads images to flickr as ""all rights reserved"".\n:Image:Haf.jpg - Flickr page states ""all rights reserved"".\n:Image:Bangtemp.jpg - Creative Commons No-Derivative license.\n:Image:Kolkahomes.jpg - All rights reserved.\n:Image:Delhimall.jpg - Creative Commons Attribution Non-commercial No-derivative license (unacceptable on Wikipedia).\n:Image:Yamun.jpg - All rights reserved.\n:Image:Kolk.jpg - All rights reserved.\n:Image:Myspalbang.jpg - All rights reserved.\n:Image:Bangalore.jpg - The link to the original source is missing; no evidence that it is under the Creative Commons license.\n:Image:Lalbagh.jpg - Taken from WikiTravel. Uploader ought to confirm that he is indeed under the author and that he has licensed it under the license indicated.\n:Image:Nagpur.JPG - Who made this image?\n\nThere are several issues here.

In particular, licenses that prohibit commercial use or making of derivative works are considered unfree and can\'t be used on Wikipedia, except as provided by the fair use policy; Creative Commons Atrribution, and Creative Commons Atrribution Sharealike licenses are okay. Also, there are multiple versions of the licenses; Creative Commons Atrribution Sharealike 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 are all distinct licenses. (The problem is that the upload dialogue only lists the 3.0 versions and not the earlier ones; when the image is under one of the older licenses, you ought to edit the image description page and correct the number. As far as I can see, Flickr only uses the 2.0 versions of the licenses.)\n\nIn addition, some of the Flickr authors have indicated that they allow the image to be used on Wikipedia, without making it clear that they release it under one of the acceptable licenses; a permission that only extends to Wikipedia is not sufficient, either. You should ask the authors to do one of the following:\nChange the Flickr page to license the image under Creative Commons Attribution (or Attribution Sharealike) license (apparently, this would change the licensing for all images, and this may not be what they intend to do);\nPost a message to the image page with a text similar to the following:\nI, creator of the image, agree to license it under the Creative Commons Attribution license (link) [alternately: under the Creative Commons Attribution Sharealike license (link). This declaration overrides any statement to the contrary on this page.\nE-mail the Wikimedia Foundation (permissions-en[AT]wikimedia[DOT]org) with a message similar to the above, also specifying which image (images) the user intends to release under the license.

It seems you were called in to quickly ""protect"" the page from editing, effectively blocking the inclusion of the figures. You cited ""edit warring,"" the more accurate term would be repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons. There are casualty figures in all the conflict, war, battle etc. Wiki articles I have referenced, why not this one? Thanks   \nRomaC, the edits which you tried to make were a set of statistics for one year only, which you attemepted to place in the first paragraph of an article describing a conflict of over sixty years. This article covers an issue of extreme sensitivity and complexity. The fact that your edits sparked so much conflict and opposition speaks for itself. Here at Wikipedia, we value the ability to achieve consensus, and to be fair to many viewpoints. And believe it or not, we often do achieve that at the article Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is not enough to disinegnuously claim that your figures were ""reliable,"" without addressing any of the underlying issues, or any of the conflicts which it clearly and immediately caused. \n\nTo repeat: statistics for just one year of the conflict do not belong anywhere in the article\'s lead. there are a wide variety of figures which either side could quote, all in the name of objectivity, which would clear and unacceptably attempt to create a slant towards one side or the other. please note, this is why we are careful when making edit to be sure that we actually have consensus, rather than simply telling others that they should provide consensus.   \n\nI strongly object to your calling me ""disinegnuous"" [sic]. You wrote on the article talk page that you agreed with Hertz1888, who argued that the statistics might be biased. Do you not regard Haaretz as a reliable source? Please explain more clearly why you feel that citing reliably-sourced and up-to-date civilian casualty statistics in an article about a war, battle or conflict is disingenuous. If you or any other editor want to add more statistics, covering a longer time period, then go ahead, but do not delete relevant content added by other editors. Yes, the edit ""sparked so much conflict and opposition"" but note also also that here at Wikipedia we do not determine what is ""fair"" through intimidation by numbers. There is a big difference between consensus and false compromise.   \n\nI apologize if you felt I was offending you in any way. i only meant to describe the appearance of your edits, not to describe you personally in any way. if other editors deleted some edits, it is because they genuinely felt there was a reason to do so, and that the material was not beneficial or fair to the article. I responded to your concerns and issues further at the article talk page. thanks.    \n\nApology accepted, and I will also make my further comments on the article talk page. I am not a single-issue editor I get around a bit on Wiki, saw the Haaretz report and very much believe it is something very relevant to the article. I can\'t say I know for certain why other editors deleted the material, I try to assume good faith, we\'ll see.   \n""repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons"" - motive doesn\'t really matter, its still edit warring, its still disruptive. Protection is not an endorsement of the current version. Z-man \nThe subject of this article is a deadly conflict, the lede is huge - and yet it contains no mention of the casualties. Clearly, there is something seriously wrong. As a result, your action here, while well-intentioned, looks highly partisan.

The English language has no board to regulate it, as French does with the L\'Académie française, so you have no basis for defining what the word means. We have groups and documents that define the proper use of words like ""you\'re"" and ""your"", for example, but none such for words like bukkake. If it can be shown that it is used in a particular way, that is valid. My personal belief is that there is no need for the qualifier ""gay"", just as there is no need to call men having anal sex ""gay anal sex"", but that\'s really irrelevent. \n\nI think it is important to make clear the historical implications, but not to deny that we are currently creating and modifying language. Even the fact that we have taken the word bukkake, ""splash"", from Japan and created this very specific connotation of splashing not just anything, but specifically semen and specifically onto a person\'s face shows that this term is elastic and subject not to rules that we impose on it, but by the meaning that it has to the people who use it.   \n\n"'], "censor":0}

(not to mention his personal talk page is one big anti-Greek rant fest pointing to questionable FYROM news sources with highly exaggerated sensationalist titles)\n\n""No, Assfuckers (has a nice ring to it D) use it as a pejorative term. \n\nI was ready to pull the trigger on both him, admin Futper, and a few others (e.g. Macedoniaboy who says he is a ""proud fighter for united Macedonia on his talk page) with a detailed complaint about anti-Greek propaganda but since Futper managed a civil discussion with me and now seems to be sticking to debating articles (rather than threats of blocking)  I\'m going to avoid escalating this further for now. ns. \n\nAs for the current naming disputing article... I agree with you that some FYROM citizens honestly believe their claims but I don\'t think that reduces the existential threat to Greece. Communism fell 17 years ago in Yugoslavia and the FYROM government appears to be getting worse not better (imagine if in two hundred years they call themselves ""ethnic Athenians"" and the cycle continues until their is no Greece left). \n\nThere appear to be important quotes missing from the naming dispute article that clearly demonstrate that FYROM leadership are confused about their own national identity (and confusing their own citizens in the process unfortunately). I tried to add this to the talk page of the article but Futper deleted it (arguing ancient Macedon is unrelated to the article even though his own editing history shows him adding an edit arguing that ancient Macedon wasn\'t Greek) I didn\'t want to get into a revert war over simply a discussion of perceived facts but since I didn\'t think those facts should be censored either I thought perhaps you could add them to discussion on the naming dispute talk page. (assuming you see it as relevant yourself of course)\n\nFebruary 26, 1992: The FYROM\'s President Kirov Gligorov, at an interview by the Foreign Information Service daily report, Easten Europe, stated: \'""We are Slavs, who came to the region in the sixth century. We are not descendants of the ancient Macedonians.\'\n\n""January 22, 1999: The FYROM\'s Ambassador in Washington D.C., Mrs. Ljubica Acevska, gave a speech on the present situation in the Balkans, she stated: \'""We do not claim to be descendants of Alexander the Great. We are Slavs and we speak a Slavic language. Greece is The FYROM\'s second largest trading partner and its number one ""investor.""\'\n\nFebruary 24, 1999: The FYROM.\'s Ambassador to Canada, Gyordan Veselinov, in an interview with the ""Ottawa Citizen"", he admitted: \'""We are not related to the northern Greeks who produced leaders like Philip and Alexander the Great. We are Slavs and our language is closely related to Bulgarian. There is some confusion about our identity.""\'\n\nI think the above needs to be compared to that of their current hard line prime minister\'s recent behavior. He directly contradicts FYROM\'s own government\'s previous comments about themselves (that apparently was unauthentically meant to assure foreigners that Greeks were imagining FYROM propaganda and to reduce the issue to a childish dispute over simply names.. in order to get recognition)\n\nPrime Minister Gruevski officially meets Prince Ghazanfar of Pakistan] who claims to be related to Alexander the Great.. then uses it as an opportunity to suggest FYROM citizens are related to ancient Macedonians.

I’m already out there concerned about this so I’m really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes, when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticism…I’ve been saying this for years, that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism. I’m for eroticism."" \n\nCamille Paglia is a major American social critic. Paglia\'s academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history. Paglia\'s key importance to sex-positive feminism is not only her writings on sex, but her advocacy of ""traditional"" values like canon texts. Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma, a conservative and academic feminist, who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture. Paglia has, in many ways, presented a ""respectable"" face for pro-sex feminism to the world at large."'], "censor":0}

I can see where the Myanmar side would be unhappy. However why should the Burma side agree to abide by the next decision? You can bet that with every panel of mediators that might side with Myanmar you will find at least as many panels that side with Burma. Husond is right, where does this end? When I first looked at this mess I said, and posted, that with the current evidence on both sides editors and mediators will NOT be able to reach a FAIR compromise that will appease both sides of this issue... no matter how much thought is put into it.

I am confronted with the information that because it is not a legal requirement as far as you know, it must be spurious.  Some people know that it\'s better to get their legal information from government sources, not Wikipedia.  If you are holding up this resource as some type of CFR or USC guide, exposition, or sanctioned resource, then I believe the U.S. Government would like to hear your ideas.  Further, ""someone you know"" (or knows you) is part of network administrationwhich is part of the brilliance.  Needing a cohort or supervisor to provide a human factor is difficult to defeat.  Though, I suspect you know this already.  I\'m not offended though, just immensely confused as to why this item of access control must be devoid of technical information and meet some arbitrary legal standard.  I would ask you this: if a user loses their SmartCard (i.e. CAC) and forgets their password, with the premise being that biometric devices or other inherence factor methodologies are not deployed, in most situations does an administrator with knowledge of the user ask they be terminated, or do they reissue credentials based on knowing the person?  There are organizations that will terminate you, but I couldn\'t have said that in my expounding of the 4th factor because it would mean citing information not available to the lay.

When we set out, it was to provide reliable information, if the mission has changed, well who could tell?  Consider me a non-contributor from now onwe aren\'t allowed to use Wikipedia anyway where I work, it is an anathema.  Say what you want unless it surprises someone and then an ego check is issued. I should expect nothing less, after all, I teach.  What changed the tone was your dumbing-down and use of nonsensical examples that could not be used to authenticate someone.  Smell?  Non-sequitur.

Just one, written in German,\n\nEinstein: Sein Leben by Denis Brian, Christine von Samson-Mark, Wiley-VCH, 2005 page 352\n\nIndem er sich den Angelegenheiten seines eigenen Landes zuwandte, empoerte sich Einstein ueber deutsche Studenten, die fuer die Entlassung eines Professors agitierten, weil dieser ein Pazifist gegen politisch motivierte Todesurteile war. ""Es ist entsertzlich zu sehen, wie die unerfahrene Jugend fehlgeleitet wird"", schrieb er an das Berliner Tageblatt. ""Wenn dies so weitergeht, werden wir \nnach einer Tyrannei der Faschisten bei einer Herrschaft des Rotten Terrors ankommen."" Er glaubte, dass eine solche Herrschaft bereits in Jugoslawien ausgeloest worden sei und kritisierte die Landesregierung fuer den Mord an dem kroatischen Fuehrer, Professor Milan Sufflay, der Geschichte an der Universitaet von Zagreb gelehrt hatte.\n\nReading further this book it is clear that the only information available to Einstein was \'The ""inside story"" of the Šufflay murder was given by the Croat journalist (Ustase propagandist), Slavko Cihlar, in the Berliner Tageblatt, February 26, 1931.\'\n\nSo, it is apparent that Einstein fell under spell of the Ustase propaganda.

In such a state, the ""European culture"" of Croatia and the Croatian was to be replaced by Serbian suzerainty, in which ""orthodox, byzantine, oriental-asiatic and oldtuc (sic) political and social traditions"" had been subsumed into a system ""not only contrary but also odious to European culture""\n\nTurda also says that ""His murder occasioned international condemnation and outrage from, among others, Albert Einstein and Heinrich Mann of the German League for the Rights of Man"" (no source was given)\n\nAbout the Sufflay murderer\n\nThinking about Yugoslavia: Scholarly Debates about the Yugoslav Breakup and the Wars in Bosnia and Kosovo by Sabrina P. Ramet, Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 254\n\nGoldstein (Croatian historian) leaves the question of agency to the side and writes simply that Šufflay, who, as he notes, was an accomplished observer of Albanian culture, \'was killed on the street in Zagreb.

Darwins model of evolution illustrates biological species as objects, and is thus no different from phylogenies of other kinds of objects (like asexually reproducing cells or mitochondria). Now, as an Object-Oriented Model, the model actually represents two consecutive objects (i.e., two objects in a row) by each of its internal lines (i.e., lines between nodes): one after a node and one before a node; the former belonging to the category (i.e., concept) 'objects after nodes' and the latter to the category 'objects before nodes'. If the model includes all objects of a certain category, then both of these make up this category. In summary: phylogenies consist of two categories (i.e., concepts) of objects: objects before nodes and objects after nodes, and if the phylogeny includes all things of a category, then these two categories make up this category.\n\n(Cladistics, or cladism as I prefer to call it, confuses the concept 'objects after nodes' with the concept 'objects before nodes' by defining lines between nodes as single things, thereby confusing category with object, that is kind with thing, thus confusing conceptualization itself. The approach is actually a return to a pre-scientific stage, this time denying the incompatibility between pattern and process instead of acknowledging it and solving it consistently. It is a return alley that no scientist had ever expected anyone to advocate. If this approach could ever be proved to be correct, then it would mean that reality only exists in our own heads. Luckily, Einstein's discovery that time is relative to space falsifies the approach (i.e., claim), and this it did even before the approach was born. Cladism was thus shown to be wrong before it emerged). Consist (presently at 83.254.20.53  )"], "censor":0}

(See Rushton & Jensen, 2005a, 2005b, Gottfredson, 2005, and Lynn & Vanhanen, 2002, for the view that the Black–White IQ difference is owing substantially to genetic differences between the races and that indirect evidence having to do with such factors as reaction time and brain size is probative. See Nisbett, 2005, 2009, for the view that the direct evidence indicates that thedifference between the races is entirely due to environmental factors and that the indirect evidence has little value.\nPlease stop lying. 211.119.109.57  \n\nThen applying the same defintion to C the answer is no. Do you see the problem here? 211.119.109.57     \n   \nQuestion C2: Is the ""Hereditiarian"" position a mainstream view?   \nThe question is whether it is a widely held mainstream view that the IQ test score gap is likely to be significantly explainable by genetic factors. Note that the question is not whether it is the only mainstream view, nor whether it has been proven to account for the entire gap, but only about whether it is considered a probable explanation by a wide selection of mainstream scholars.   \n\nYes. 211.119.109.57     \n   \nQuestion D2: Is Richard Nisbett considered a mainstream scientist?   \nThe question is whether Nisbett as a person and a scholar is generally considered to be within the mainstream of the field of Psychology. The question is not whether he is prominent and notable enough to be included, but about whether his views should be given equal weight to mainstream views within the article.   \n   \nNo. Nisbett holds a minority view which has been described as having \'virtually no chance of being true\' by a reliable tertiary source. 211.119.109.57  "'], "censor":0}

Is Algeria ""minor?"" Iran? It\'s a nonsense phrase, so it should be deleted. As for making ""MA"" a country code for Western Sahara, it\'s not. MA is a code for Morocco, and so it is in Morocco\'s infobox. EH was created for Western Sahara, so that is its country code. As far as the territory being occupied, this is a clear fact and the position of the United Nations; it is also mentioned in the article in other places. -❤T☮C☺M☯ \nIt does not need a definition to be in the article. A minor state is used as opposed to super-power states, permanent members of the security council, ... etc. As to the EH domain, it clearly states the .eh tld is intended for WS but it is not assigned, "".MA"" being the one used in the territory. The same thing applies for the currency, the MAD is the currency of Morocco, but that is also the currency you will find in use in the territory. The same thing goes for the IAC 212, the Time zone +0 UTC, etc. They are the ones used in the territory. These things have been a matter of hotted debate before and they settled on the way they have been before you started tempering with them. As to your ridiculous claim of the UN considering the territory as occupied, I already explained to you the difference between a UN position through the security council that is reiterated again and again, and a voting poll in 1979 of the Algerian-Cuban drafted document, that has no obligation on the UN. The ""Zionism=Racism"" example is the brightest one for you to understand it. I will revert to the version that was in use before the anon IP started this mess.  \nIt does Since ""minor states"" doesn\'t mean anything, you can\'t use it in this article; it\'s nonsense. What states that "".ma"" is being used in the territory? Do you have any evidence of this at all? The same thing does not apply to currency, since there is no administrative body that assigns currencies to regions. To ask which currency is used in a region is different than to ask which top-level domain name has been assigned to the region; the former is defined entirely by usage, the latter is defined entirely by standards. Western Sahara is clearly occupied, as the article itself still states; I\'m not going through this with you again. -❤T☮C☺M☯ \n Ah we\'re back to having fun again arguing about trivialities. Minor states is indeed a value judgement - although arguably the states recognizing are largely minor on the global arena (Algeria is not a big newsmaker per se). But in the interest of neutrality, merely noting ""African, Asian, and Latin American"" states seems reasonable. At the same time, if Koavf gets to bleat on about minor, it seems reasonable that controlled be used rather than occupied. Same standards on language. (  )\n Evidence on .ma usage would be found with sites for entities ostensibly domiciled in Western Sahara provinces using .ma. It is trivially easy to find that. Koavf\'s immature partisanship notwithstanding. (  )\nWhat is an example of a website with an .ma domain name which has the server in Western Sahara? « D. Trebbien (talk) 23:40 2008 May 5 (UTC)\n Good question. Since effectively all internet service to the Western Sahara is via Maroc Telecom or other Moroccan operators, one would expect that most servers would be located in Moroccan territory (ex-WS provinces), largely in the Casa-Rabat area. Technically I am unaware of any way to determine where the physical server is actually located (versus the service). Presumably the Regional Investment Office of Laayoune (http://www.laayouneinvest.ma/fr/index.asp) may have its server physically in Laayoune. Other similar offices may also. It strikes me as useful for the article to indicate like country code, most sites use the Moroccan address (.ma). Polisario partisans may not like that, but its effective reality.

{"sentence": ['"\n\nMario Party 4 is the fourth in a series of board game style video games for Nintendo platforms, featuring popular Nintendo characters. It was released on the Nintendo GameCube in North America on October 21, 2002 strangely before the Japanese release on November 8, 2002. It was released on November 29, 2002 in Europe, being heavily criticised for being \'Nintendo\'s big GameCube Game\' for Christmas 2002 as Metroid Prime was delayed until March 2003.\n\nMario Party 4 was the first Mario Party that was released on the Nintendo GameCube. Each board had its own host, including Toad, Goomba, Shy Guy, Koopa, and Boo. Mario Party 4 also contains some characters new to the franchise; Thwomp and Whomp. Klepto, Dolphin, Lakitu, and Star, along with two completely new characters named Genie of the Lamp and Ztar, are included as well. Mario Party 4 retains the Story Mode found in Mario Party 3.\n\nThe game, as usual, contains a standard party mode in which up to four players play through a board, trying to collect as many Stars as possible. The Star Space would appear randomly on the board, and players would have to reach it before anyone else. However, the Stars carry a price tag of 20 coins, and player has to earn those coins by winning minigames, which take place at the end of each turn (after all the players have rolled the Dice Block, which will always roll a number from one to ten).\n\nBattle minigames are like the 4-player games, but generally (with many exceptions) a little more elaborate. Battle games are usually tense because every player has to put a certain number of coins (from 5 - 50) into a pot. First place gets 70% of the pot, second place gets 30%, and a random player gets any coins lost in rounding. \n\nEvery Mario Party contains 60 to 80 minigames of a few different types. Four-player games are a free-for-all in which all players compete against each other. 2-on-2 and 1-on-3 minigames put players in groups, so they have to cooperate in the minigame to win, even though they are against each other in the main game. In most situations, winners of these games make 10 coins each.\n\nA new addition to the Mario Party series was the Bowser mini-games. Players play in a very elaborate mini-game that ends when one player is eliminated in various ways. (See Bowser mini-game section below) The loser loses a pre-specified item, usually coins or items.\n\nGameplay\nBoards\n Toad\'s Midway Madness\n Goomba\'s Greedy Gala\n Koopa\'s Seaside Soiree\n Shy Guy\'s Jungle Jam\n Boo\'s Haunted Bash\n Bowser\'s Gnarly Party (Clear Story Mode to unlock it)\n\nSpaces\nThere is various spaces you can land in the game. The following is a list of them, and what they do.\nBlue Space - You get three coins. Also, there is a special feature on this game called Hidden Blocks, in which a star or coins may be hidden on random blue spaces.\nRed Space - You lose three coins.\nGreen Happening Space - A special board event takes place.\nWarp Space - You are sent to the same space as an opponent. A spinner chooses which opponent\'s space you will warp to.\nMushroom Space - Two boxes will appear (one big and one small).

{"sentence": ['"\n\n Hie DVdm. I was writing what follows while you made your edit. I can\'t right now, but I will coming to review in detail your example.\nThanks Johnuniq for your advice and input. Concerning the actual statement, I had already thought that after clearing things up with DVdm, I would rephrase it into something in the lines of ""He is an iconic and inspirational reference for the generation growing up in the late 1970s, early 1980s."" Adding ""to some of the generation"" should clear your objection about the absence of stats. But that\'s not the really important issue here. The fact is that it is ethically improper from me and from Wikipedia to declare that the (you call it blog) site is not a reliable source here, but then find that the links and statements in ""Inertia Coupling"" or ""Alexander Abian"" are significant enriching contributions to the users of Wikipedia, and the sourced site is reliable there. BTW, in these two and the few other topics the source is mentioned, the statements leading to the source links would qualify as synthesis. It would be highly objectionable from Wikipedia to keep those links unchallenged for the time being, and when someone gets around to rewriting the original material in the specific blog posts, the links will be trashed out. At this point 1) The sentence being vague and inaccurate can be corrected. 2) It seems that if you articulate a sentence validated by some sort of source that is not a direct quote, in most cases some synthesis is involved. 3) There is still the issue of the site being a reliable source. It seems to me that the Wikipedia efforts to keep the wackos with weird theories at bay, is leading editors to substitute verifiability, intelligibility and common sense by arguments of authority. This would set me going into a long winded argument about what is happening to Wikipedia, once lauded as the place ""to come as you are,"" becoming stiff, purely factual and tight in such a way that it carries a lot of knowledge but no understanding. This in turn carries into a discussion about public education, and the work that Carl Sagan is known to the general public for. Cosmos was not about this marble statue said so but instead these are the reasons why we think so. To me the posts in the disputed site I linked to are interesting (but that maybe just my own personal opinion) and Wikipedia users having them available is positive, constructive and enriching for Wikipedia, and that\'s the reason I linked to them in the first place. Throwing them out, all of them, seems like excluding a whole plethora of good things, the baby with the bath water, because a Wikipedia directive says so, just because it does, not noticing the directives were written to prevent bad things from happening, it would seem to me, not to exclude good things by statute.

Their research seemed to refer only to lead in aqueous media on paper, although that wasn\'t absolutely clear. But lead paint is almost never used that way! Artists working in transparent watercolor (aquarelle) don\'t usually use white paint, or just occasionally a bit of ""Chinese White"" (not lead) to make corrections. And opaque watercolors (gouache) and acrylic (polymer) artist\'s paints typically use titanium dioxide or (rarely) zinc white, but never lead. Normally ""flake white"" is used only by oil painters, and there\'s no indication in the study that they were referring to oil paints.

I did so last night, and not under a pseudonym as most people have. I always use my real name in signatures.\n\nAnd I don\'t know how to post to your talk page because there appears to be no ""post"" link.\n\nThanks,\nDennis Bathory-Kitsz\nbathory@bathory.org\nbathory@maltedmedia.com\n\nThanks for your message but I think perhaps my meaning was still unclear.  Whether you register or not doesn\'t really matter since anyone can register under any name.  I could go online and register a Wikipedia account as George W. Bush (at least, if it\'s not already taken).  Wikipedia has no means to authenticate your identity independently.  All that we know - all that we can know - is what you choose to claim about yourself.  \n\nThat\'s what I meant by pseudonymously - any registration, even if you say that it\'s your real name, is technically a pseudonym.  It is not independently verified against some external identity database.  And for the most part, that works out very well on Wikipedia.  We want users and editors to establish themselves through their actions and to demonstrate their expertise through their edits, not by making claims to outside credentials.\n\nBy the way, anyone could also register as Dennis Bathory-Kitzs.  That trivial misspelling would be easily overlooked by readers but would still be accepted by the system.  Such a person could sign their name the same way you do, attempt to mimic your pattern of speech (well, writing really) and make subtle edits just to discredit you.  That, in fact, is a real problem for established editors of Wikipedia.  When we find usernames that are suspiciously similar to established users, we look very carefully for signs of vandalism or deceit.  Users who appear to have done something like that on purpose are generally banned from Wikipedia.  But those are all manual checks.  There is no system that can automatically detect or prevent it.\n\nLikewise, no one can inherently trust the email address.  The way internet domains are set up, anyone could register bathory.org and create any email name they wanted.  Like Wikipedia accounts, emails and internet domains are unverified against any external identity authority.  And that\'s before you consider the problems of email spoofing and forgery - both of which are far easier and common today than any of us would like to admit.\n\nMost people are honest.  But there are enough dishonest people out there that we have to build our systems and our procedures in such a way that it doesn\'t matter whether they are telling the truth about their identity or not.  That\'s why Wikipedia has a policy against original research (which we mean as ""a contribution or assertion based on personal experience"") and why we never rely solely on self-published materials and why we bias our policy so strongly in favor of reliable sources such as websites owned by and operated by large, well-known organizations - organizations with both a vested interest in and the resources to find and stop spoofing.\n\nSorry to bore you with all this but my non-Wikipedia profession is information security.  The inherent problems of identity management and authentication occupy much of my waking hours.  How can a bank know that you\'re really you?  And how far can that trust be extended?  Under what conditions can an assertion be treated as reliable?  How do we balance that against the need to make systems and computers easy and accessible.  Unfortunately, there are no easy answers short of establishing a national identity database - something which would be in great tension with my role as a privacy advocate.  \n\nAnyway, I\'ll get off my soapbox now.  Thanks for your message.\n\nTo post to my Talk page, just go to the page and edit it like you would edit any page on Wikipedia.  The most common technique is to use the little plus sign next to the ""edit this page"" tab at the top.  That will automatically create a new section and give you a line to create a section header without having to know the wiki-markup symbols.  You should also get in the habit of signing your posts on Talk pages.  You can do that easily by ending your comment with four tildes (~~~~).  When you save the page, the MediaWiki software will replace the tildes with your username and the date-timestamp.\n\nAgain, welcome to Wikipedia.   (talk) "'], "censor":0}

For example, print and television journalists and their readers and viewing audiences can deem things notable as well. Nor do academics have a monopoly on logical or factual correctness, scholarly integrity, or intellectual merit, except possibly in the well-indoctrinated minds of some academics themselves (and of course, their aspiring apprentices, whose eager anticipation of scholastic glory sometimes inflates their academic snobbery to blimpish proportions).\n\nByrgenwulf complains that ""we chaps"" are not the sole arbiters of what belongs in the article. This is correct. To his credit, he invites others to tag his assertions. However, this is a bit specious, for having belatedly come to the realization that he has no relevant, verifiable assertions to make, he is now specializing in challenging the assertions of others. Thus, we now find him imperiously and rather comically demanding that every one of Langan\'s assertions receive a separate citation, when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertions are made is already directly linked to the article. \n\nIt is important for Byrgenwulf to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents. Not only must he provide a legitimate citation for anything he wishes to add to the article, but given that the article already links to ample source material, anything he wants to remove or qualify must be proven false, irrelevant, or non-neutral. Unfortunately, he hasn\'t yet been able to lock onto this signal. He still labors under the assumption that like some sort of Ultimate Bureaucrat, he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of verification without verifying anything himself.  \n\nBy now, everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization: neither Byrgenwulf, nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates, HAS any citations or other sources of verification for their own accusations. They are merely using the article, which is faithful to the material it cites, to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic, the CTMU, which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news networks. They do not like what the CTMU says; the article on the CTMU reports on what the CTMU says, and what Langan and the press say about the CTMU; hence, they do not like the article on the CTMU. \n\nThis conflation of the article with the theory is reflected in Byrgenwulf\'s transparent strategy of attacking the theory through the article, attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger. Meanwhile, he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of Wikipedia verifiability policy, and that his all-too-evident editorial bias is in massive violation of NPOV as well. Oozing contempt, Byrgenwulf has rumbled into the middle of the CTMU article with a load of summary demands, snide remarks, and self-righteous, factually worthless criticism...but not one relevant citation in hand! Nothing he says is verifiable; as we have now repeatedly seen, he cannot even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert.

On top of that South Ossetians & Abkahzians are Russian citizens so this would mean that they are in fact part of the Russian Federation.

While W&M; used the word fossil in the previous sentence it is clear that they were referring to organic remains because by definition, recently buried remains (such as what is ""now occurring"") are not fossils.  From the ""Dictionary of Geologic Terms"", 3rd edition, 1984, by Bates and Johnson:  FOSSIL:  Any remains, trace, or imprint of a plant or animal that has been preserved in the earth\'s crust since some past geologic or prehistoric time.  Nothing buried in the present can be a fossil, for it is in historic time.  And further, you do not quickly bury fossils to preserve them, you quickly bury organic remains to protected them long enough so they they can eventually become fossils in some future geologic era.\n\nW&M; likely used the term fossil loosely, like many editors of this WP page, to refer to organic remains that might become fossils per definition in some geologic era in the future.  It is unfortunate that W&M; were not as precise as they might have been, because uninformed people, such as Talk.Origins, misunderstand and twist what they said.\n\nAs much impact as W&M; have had on Creationary thought, nearly all fellow creationist today recognize that The Genesis Flood, is now way out of date.

One need look no further than my user page where I quote Chris Hedges: ""They control our systems of information."" and add: Surely no one could be so naive as to believe that corporations do not have an interest in turning our encyclopedia into a corporate-approved encyclopedia.  At a certain point one must admit that to not fight the creep of corporate control into our articles really does make us appear to be a bunch of easily-led, lame-brained, losers just willing to go along with the flow rather than to tackle the problem and try to come up with some sort of strategy.  What, if anything, is presently being done?  I\'m aware that a few years ago an editor asked for some sort of outside check to ""prove"" that he had no COI related to the articles he edits, and I\'ve heard of this incident dozens of times since, where it is raised as absolute evidence of a lack of conflict of interest.  Many times I\'ve wondered how Wikipedia went about finding this so-called proof. If I put myself in a position in which I was editing for pay but denied it, how could it be proven that I was?  I mention this because the first thing you know all a paid editor need do is have WP give him/her the WP Stamp of Approval and from then on that editor is home free to do as they please.  They can now proudly display their badge of approval and anyone who questions them is now seen as a disgruntled editor in need of a reality check.    "'], "censor":0}

It\'s intended for images which are themselves iconic works of art so that we can use the images to primarily facilitate discussion of the image. \n\nEven ignoring the legal problems with using the news photography: Wikipedia has a hard requirement for freely licensed images because non-free media compromises the freely licensed status of Wikipedia. Refer to the first rule at WP:NFCC; non-free images are not to be used unless obtaining a freely licensed could not be reasonably believed to be possible. There were undoubtedly thousands of photographs of this balloon taken by amateurs and professionals alike, almost any would do for the purposes of the article. Wikinews claims that the balloon was low-flying and that photographs were captured by area residents.  \n\nThe best way to get an image for the article would be to leave a placeholder in the article requesting that the public submit one. The effectiveness of such a place holder will probably diminish over time as the attention on this incident dies down. I\'ve been checking flickr and other photo sites but have so far come up dry, though sometimes it takes a little while for people to bother uploading their photographs.\n\nI hope I haven\'t given the impression that I do not appropriate your contributions to the article— as I do, especially your efforts to use even and neutral language in the face of a media environment eager to describe the parties unfavourably.

Should sort AMD64 or Intel64 implementations as x86? Generally ""x86"" was used to point all the processors compatible with IA-32 ISA, might or might name themselves with ""86"", such as Cyrix 5x86, Intel Pentium 4 and so on. AMD64\'s long mode is devised by AMD rather than Intel, so how can one sort them together. Nowadays software labeled themselves as ""x86"" are IA-32 compatible software, and use ""x64"" or ""x86-64"" differentiating with it. So this article confuses reader getting in touch with this word. \n\n2. Generations? What is the 8th generation x86 processor? Who invented this kinda processors? AMD K8 just says that it succeeds AMD K7 rather than saying it is the 8th x86 processor, and I\'ve never heard Intel call their x86 processors exceeding the 7th generation. And one thing should never be denied, the first generation of Itanium processor says its family model number as 7, which might potentially imply that Itanium might be the 7th x86 processor succeeding Pentium III, but none confirmed this. So take turn back the Transmeta\'s Crusoe and Efficeon, if the morph firmed on the system board implements x86 decoder call themselves as x86 processors, then if put the same processor on another board implementing PowerPC decoder, then it would be the PowerPC processor? At this situation, what kind of processor is it? Ridiculous! What\'s more for what sort it as the 7th/8th generation x86? Who is another Jane Austen, making up another Northanger Abbey?\n\n3. ""x86"" is one architecture(ISA) name? What such a ridiculous thing that I\'ve ever heard on earth! ""x86"" is used to referring the processor, a kind or series of processors rather than an architecture. If it were the name of an architecture, then in this logic way, Intel 80486 is one of the ""implementation"" of this ""architecture""?   "'], "censor":0}

And when did a little looking around there, finding an entry about NYB, for example, who had advised AGK that he didn\'t see any misconduct in some of the points of the FoF, so it was thirdly an indirect suggestion that he learn something from someone that is already an accomplished attorney. \n\nIf the reiteration of material deleted by AGK from his User page within the past two weeks is ""outing"", then that is a policy I shall have to examine. Note that I am not the only editor to have broached the issue of his being an undergraduate in the context of his judgment and actions acting in the capacity of arbitrator in the case at issue.\n\nThere\'s much more to say on this, but I need to get a couple more hours of sleep. I have tried to leave links to relevant discussions at Jimbo\'s talk page, but have only provided a partial synthesis of the situation, not even contrasting the complete lack of an FoF on Arzel, for instance, with the response provided to me on the PD talk page shortly after the case was officially closed yesterday.\n\nIf this statement settles some of the concerns regarding my intentions, and the severity of the infractions thereby diminished, I would appreciate a reduction of the length of the block to facilitate my engaging in the necessary efforts to conduct the appeal without having to exclusively rely on the email system.  連絡 見学/迷惑 "'], "censor":0}

Of these, only the first is common.\n\nAnd on page 25 \n\nA statistical analysis of Kaingang genealogies for a period of 100 years showed that 8 per cent of all recorded unions were group marriages, as compared with 14 per cent for polyandrous, 18 per cent for polygynous, and 60 per cent for monogamous unions.\n\nThe disadvantage of working at a medical school is that the anthropology texts are not extensive, but they aren't checked out often either.

{"sentence": ['"Kenneth Tennyson\'s reckless behavior in other forums==\n\nAs far as Kenneth Tennyson bashing other authors, here is an exerpt from a book review on Amazon.com:\n\nFounder of the homemade Mushindo Karate movement, never studied under a legitimate teacher, or any martial art teacher, never set foot in Asia, completely disproven, shown to have plagiarized many photos and other materials from other published written sources. Of course he claims to have studied under masters in Tibet, and been a disciple of Okinawan Karate teachers - since disproven by such worthy sources as Gorge Mattson, et al. Was involved in an abusive sex scandal with several female students a few years back (""Sleep with me and I\'ll enlighten you"" kinda thing), uses abusive and coercive tactics to control what ex-students say at him, a propaganda liemaster. \n\nThe person he is bashing is none other than Terrence Dukes (or the real Frank Dukes from the movie Bloodsport)\n\nWhile putting others down, Kenny brags, or advertises about his martial arts expertise to scare people:\n\nHmmm... well, kalaripayattu has a lot of similarities with caopera, alot of jumping and posturing, and a lot of religious themes to it. I guess it depends on what martial arts you\'ve trained in to determine whether I can kick A$$ or not. let\'s see... I\'m a red belt second degree in tae kwon do and have some knowledge in shotoken. I\'ve got to start learning about grappling though. \n\nFreedom skies and myself are not the only ones who feel that Kenny is a racist. Here are some excerpts from users from other forums:\n\n(The Armchair Analyst - Asia Times Forum)\nI see. However, you sounded like a racist.\nNo, I have no ""South Asian sensitivities"". I am no nationalist/jingoist. I consider myself above it all. \n\nALL your posts are based on the rather silly assumption that militaristic power in the last three centuries is a sign of ""greatness"". It may be in a narrow Anglo-saxon way, but not in a Gandhi-Buddha sort of a way. Get it?\n\nCivilizations such as India (actually even China until today) have NEVER had a negative impact on other civilizations that remotely matches yours.\n\nYou have generalized Indians to be bigots etc., I agree that SOME not all are. But the fact that you generalized it to include an entire ethnic group as ""obnoxious"", by definition makes you a racist. YES IT DOES! \n\n(rocky - Asia Times Forum)\nWhat inaccuracy are you referring to? If Brits came to India and got rich, was the wealth Indian or British? Besides looting, what exactly did British accomplish? While your bias is clearly visible with this statement, what is your purpose of posting this in this forum?\n\nIsnt it quiet evident that even in yr 2005, it is difficult for you to get off your pompus ass, why on earth would anything written by Anglo-Saxon when Europeans were busy colonizing the world accurate? Isnt there a vested interest on part of the European to disparage Native Cultures and delibrately belittle their achievements? \n\nThat\'s just a couple of the many others. However, I do not want to clog up this page.\n\nI have also noticed that Kenny tends to have a habit of cutting and pasting articles, and also cloning the article he had fabricated on a few web sites  I know that I am not the only one who knows this:\'(Brahman - Martial Arts Planet Forum)i really do hate to post on this topic seems as it was only to counter mine, which by the way it would be nice if you would simply post this on my topic were you could get a real discusion, were as here people might simply ignore you becuase of the topic cloning. \n\n(Bliss - Asia Times Forum)Thats not from a \'social studies journal\' you fraud, thats a copy paste... \n\n(rocky - Asia Times Forum)I believe Kenneth probably picked up a web-site of some Tourist Board'], "censor":0}

{"sentence": ['"\n\nHmmm. I was actually writing a response as you sent yours. Oh well. For the record, my response was this:\n\nResurrecting articles is frowned upon, yes. We might be able to get away with it if the article we resurrect is a substantial improvement on the last one, however - though of course we both know that there\'s no guarantee it would ultimately be accepted whatever we did - there is an established bias towards deleting articles on individual matches. Changing the name would be nice but I\'m not sure what we would change to...the game didn\'t really have a ""name"" like the Ballet on Ice or any such, and there are limited other ways of naming the article.\n\nMaking this subpage was a decent idea, you just got unlucky in that it\'s something that has already been tried elsewhere and ultimately voted against. Honestly I can say I\'ve never seen a subpage for an actual mainspace article so I have no idea how much people tend to chase these articles up or whether it might just glean a community-wide shrugging of the shoulders. Certainly there\'s been no AfD nomination yet, which is a start. I have to say I somewhat favour making it a standalone article or merging with the season article (i.e. not keeping the subpage) but I don\'t have strong feelings so I\'ll run with whatever works. If it got categorised it would either be put into a category for something like Category:Football matches (I have no idea if that exists, it was another example) and Category:FA Cup and then probably into a new category for City matches or comebacks or somesuch where it probably would be on its own. That category would then have to be categorised so it wasn\'t just an orphan. I don\'t know what the ethic is here for creating categories with only a single article in them but I suspect it\'s not encouraged, so that idea might be rejected if (whoever did it) couldn\'t find more like-minded articles to categorise into the same. I don\'t think it being categorised would really affect anyone\'s opinion of the article though. The one thing that might affect peoples\' judgement right now is that it will (in its present form) show up in categories as ""2003–04 Manchester City F.C. season/Spurs 3-4 City"" or however the subpage is actually named, given the / in the name.\n\nYes, I\'d say it will currently be located in an overarching ""please categorise these pages"" category. I don\'t know how long it would take for it to get sorted, but it would probably be put somewhere generic. Better to do it ourselves, I guess.\n\nSorry my thoughts were a bit disjointed but I was answering the points as they came and...well, better English just didn\'t quite flow from my fingers as I typed. Hopefully I addressed all your points. I\'ll settle for just keeping the subpage if you want it, though I think that page would be best served by being redone - with as many citations as possible - and expanded upon, so we can argue a case for it being reincluded into society, so to speak. Having an article AfD\'ed isn\'t a permanent sign that that article should never exist, it\'s merely a suggestion that it shouldn\'t exist in the state it\'s in. Generally speaking most articles that get deleted will be kept the second time around if their quality and/or level of detail is substantially improved.\n\nAs for the Charity Shield, I always considered it a notable trophy. Yes, it\'s a single game, but it requires winning a trophy to qualify in the first place (ignoring those early years when some teams refused to play). To this end, I\'d consider it more of an accomplishment than winning the trophy which qualified you for it. Similarly, would you question the worthiness of the European Super Cup? In fact, because some teams initially didn\'t enter, City were instrumental in making the Charity Shield the respected competition it is today by taking their place in the competition twice. You could argue that of all the teams to have ever played in it, we should be the ones most ardently defending it.  Talk "'], "censor":0}

In their interviews for the Beatles Anthology series, the surviving band members stated they knew at the time this would very likely be the final Beatles\' product, and therefore they agreed to set aside their differences and ""go out on a high note.""re. the position of ""The End"":""The End"" was initially intended to be the final track on Abbey Road, but it is followed by ""Her Majesty"". In the first practice mix of the medley, constructed on 30 July, ""Her Majesty"" followed ""Mean Mr. Mustard""...\n\n...etc.  This labyrinth has already been walked through a thousand times by a thousand people.]\n 09:58"'], "censor":0}

It is perfectly accurate and reasonable to reflect his won lost record.  There is no reason to delete it, other than your penchant for disruptive edits.  Kindly desist.  \n\nIt has also been explained to you, with proper citations, that the plural of RBI is RBIs.  Pls stop edit warring this point.  See Juan Encarnación and Terry Tiffee.  That is vandalism.  \nRun batted in says: ""The term may be pluralized as either RBI or RBIs"". Obviously not vandalism then but a difference in opinion then.\n@Matt Guerrier, the reason it didn\'t show up was because a ""|"" was missing, and with your edit you re-removed it and duplicated info.\nIt\'s amazing how you continue to assume bad faith, blindly reverting and editwarring over messages on his own talk page... \xa0(t\xa0/\xa0c) \n\nDanged if this little war isn\'t over some seriously picayune crap. Both sides are being a bit petty here, because really either set of edits is acceptable on these pages (well, except for the bolded Contract on Ian Kinsler  either make it a subhed or take it off, seriously).\n\nOh, and technically, the plural of RBI is RsBI, but that just looks clunky. In common usage, ""RBI"" is used for either singular ""Run Batted In"" or plural ""Runs Batted In"". ""RBIs"" is a bastardization used only because it\'s simpler from a usage standpoint.\n\nEither way, I think everyone involved in this should chill out for a few days and just leave all these pages alone. -  \n\nJackal4, again, is making a rash of these edits on every page I touch.  As to RBIs, as X96lee15 pointed out the most thorough treatment is at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Baseball/Archive_5#RBIs.  Plus, mlb.com is the official reporter of baseball, and uses the RBIs convention.  Yet, Jackal4\'s reaction to that is to go on pages where I have written it thus, to delete the s  as though the s is incorrect.  He has done the same with ""at bat""  which he insists must be hyphenated.  Etcetera .... these are just two of the types of reverts he feels impelled to make of my edits.  It is picayune, but it is wrong to revert perfectly good edits.  If he insisted on lower-casing RBIs, or any similar degradation, I would think it wrong of him to follow people around and revert perfectly good edits.  There is enough good work he could perform instead.  \n\n Well, I can\'t stop him from wasting time if that\'s what he wants to do ) .\n\n As for ""thorough treatment"", I\'m not sure I consider a bit to which a grand total of two people contributed particularly thorough. I respect Kingturtle, but I think he\'s got it wrong on this one. Regarding what mlb.com uses, you\'re appealing to the wrong authority, because it\'s not a terminology issue, it\'s a grammar issue.\n\n In any case, at this point I have no doubt that these edits are being reverted simply because you\'re both watching for each other\'s names on your watchlists. Allow me to again encourage the both of you to just stay away from each other\'s edits entirely for a while and allow the bad feelings to ebb. At the rate you\'re going, you\'re both going to get blocked. -  \n\nJargon overrides grammar. To say that a batter ""flied out"" is probably not good grammar either, but it\'s proper baseball terminology.

This allegation would not only deny the genocide committed against the ethnic group concerned, but would also incite hatred against this group. In the future, all Member States would be compelled to criminalise such a case.\n\n Whether a specific historical crime falls within these definitions must be decided in each concrete case by the court which has jurisdiction. In the case of the Holocaust, for example, this was done by the Nuremberg Tribunal.\n As we see, the law is restricted to cases, when:\n the commission of genocide is established by an international court and\n the denial is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred\nIs the commission of Armenian genocide established by an international court?
